    Dang it!

    Things still aren't right on this machine.  Now we have a critical business app that won't run.

    /tmp/critical-app

    Can you make it so that we can run this app again?

    Keep an eye on the time!

    That **NATE** guy must be getting fired today...

Our critical business app isn't running correctly.

```
/var/tmp/critical-app
```


Our app (above) won't work, can you fix it?

We need that super critical application working!

The remaining time is displayed above this instruction pane.

Good Luck!

Sheesh, this **NATE** guy, I wonder if this is a resume-generating event for him...
