    # Goal:

    The deployment phase is how we move from the OCI image to a running host. This is essentially an installation but with a slight variation in tools. This only needs to be done once in the lifetime of a host. We'll look at how updates operate later.

    In this exercise, we'll convert the OCI image into a disk image we can launch as a VM.

Launch bootc-image-builder
===

To this point, we've been dealing with standard OCI images and tools. However, bootc images are intended to be systems, not run like application containers.

To boot this image as a host, we install it to the filesystem using `bootc`. But `bootc` doesn't know anything about creating disks or machines.

There are several ways to deploy a bootc image to a host, depending on the target environment. For the purposes of this lab, we'll create a QCOW2 image to be run on a KVM virtual machine. To build the QCOW2 image we'll use a tool called `bootc-image-builder`.

> [!NOTE]
> This operation will take 5 minutes to complete.

```bash,run
podman run --rm --privileged \
        --volume .:/output \
        --volume ./config.json:/config.json \
        --volume /var/lib/containers/storage:/var/lib/containers/storage \
        registry.redhat.io/rhel9/bootc-image-builder:latest \
        --local \
        --type qcow2 \
        --config config.json \
         [[ Instruqt-Var key="CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT" hostname="rhel" ]]/test-bootc
```

This tool is a containerized version of image builder that includes the `bootc` tooling to unpack the container image contents to the virtual disk. Supported output formats include AMIs and VMDKs. For bare metal, we can use Anaconda with `bootc` support to install to physical disk. Other typical ways we'd install a RHEL host, like over PXE or HTTP Boot are also available to us. Using the `--local` option and adding the system container storage path as a volume allows `bootc-image-builder` to use the image directly from disk. You can also pull the image from the remote registry by omitting these lines.

Prepare and run the bootc image
===

To launch a KVM guest, copy the QCOW2 disk image we created to the default libvirt storage pool.

```bash,run
cp qcow2/disk.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/bootc[[ Instruqt-Var key="BOOTC_RHEL_VERSION" hostname="rhel" ]]-vm.qcow2
```

Using `virt-install` we can define a simple VM and import the new disk image.

```bash,run
virt-install --name bootc-vm \
--disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/bootc[[ Instruqt-Var key="BOOTC_RHEL_VERSION" hostname="rhel" ]]-vm.qcow2 \
--import \
--memory 2048 \
--graphics none \
--osinfo rhel9-unknown \
--noautoconsole \
--noreboot
```

Once the VM has been defined, we can start it.

```bash,run
virsh start bootc-vm
```

Attach to the console of the VM running our bootc image
===

Next, attach to the console. Switch to the [button label="VM console" background="#ee0000" color="#c7c7c7"](tab-1) tab.

> [!NOTE]
> If the console hasn't connected or there is an error, you can reconnect by clicking Refresh next to the tab name. The prompt will look like this. ![](../assets/terminal_prompt.png)

Check the VM is running the applications we installed
===

Once the system has finished booting, you can log in with the following credentials. These were injected by `bootc-image-builder` when creating the disk image. There are several ways to handle user creation and authentication methods, customizing the disk image with `bootc-image-builder` is just one.

In the [button label="VM console" background="#ee0000" color="#c7c7c7"](tab-1) tab, log into the vm with the following credentials.

Username:

```bash,run
core
```

Password:

```bash,run
redhat
```

The initial image included Apache, so let's check on it's status

```bash,run
systemctl status httpd --no-pager
```

The output will look like this.

Let's check if the editor `vim` was installed.

```bash,run
which vim
```

![](../assets/no_vim.png)

Somehow, we missed installing our standard editor!

Let's add vim to our image in the next step
