title: Resolving issues with Red Hat Insights Advisor
description: |
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to register a system with
  Red Hat Insights and remediate issues that the Advisor tool has identified on
  the system.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Register a system with Red Hat Insights
  * View Insights Advisor results that are reported for the system on cloud.redhat.com
  * Apply a recommeded remediation for the system
  * Validate the remediation by updating system information

  # Example Usecase:
  Administrators want to know about problematic configurations prior to
  experiencing problems on systems.  Insights Advisor will look at data
  provided to the Advisor service and compare it against known problematic
  configurations and not only warn administrators through the service, but
  provide step-by-step remediation instructions and often times an Ansible
  playbook which can remediate the issue.


  Feel free to try out other Insights included services like Vulnerability,
  Compliance, Patch, and more.  We may add additional labs targeted to those
  Insights applications as well.
