# CPU performance at-a-glance

Navigate to the system Overview, Performance metrics section

Notice the graph that shows the CPU, Disk I/O and Network utilization

![Look at Perf Activity at a glance](../assets/Perf_at_a_glance2.png)

There are vertical lines for each system resource - CPU, Memory, Disk and Network

For CPU, the graph on the left of the line shows the **utilization**, and the graph on the right of the graph shows the **saturation**
