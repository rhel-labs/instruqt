title: An overview of Red Hat Insights
description: |
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to identify vulnerabilities that
  affect systems registered to Red Hat Insights using the Red Hat Insights Vulnerability tool.
  They will also learn how to remdediate these vulnerabilities.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * View Red Hat Insights Vulnerability results that are reported for the system on console.redhat.com.
  * Apply a recommeded remediation for the system.
  * Validate that the remediation was successful.

  # Example Usecase:
  You need to report out what systems are impacted by a given vulnerability, or generate
  a report showing what CVEs may impact your fleet for auditing purposes.

  Systems are impacted by a new vulnerability which a remediation exists for.
  Administrators would like to apply specific fixes to their systems without the
  need for broader system updates.
