In this lab, you will install Grafana, a browser-based data visualization tool. You will install Grafana as a container and manage it through Podman.

First, install RHEL Container Tools by running the following command:
```bash
dnf install -y container-tools
```
Container Tools includes Podman along with other applications that make it easier to manage containers on RHEL, and it is available for all RHEL subscriptions, including the free [Developer Subscription for Individuals](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/faqs-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux#). To learn more about Podman, check out this helpful [Podman Cheat Sheet](https://developers.redhat.com/cheat-sheets/podman-cheat-sheet).

Using `systemctl`, start Podman and allow it to start every time the system boots:
```bash
systemctl enable --now podman
```
