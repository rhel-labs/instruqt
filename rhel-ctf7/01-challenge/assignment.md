    # Deep Swaps

    Search and replace is a pretty common task for a system administrator.  in /srv/ you'll find a deep directory structure full of text files.  I want you to replace all of the instances of the word "dingo" with the word "kangaroo"

    Don't modify any other files though! Or move them around.  We'll know...

    Have fun!
