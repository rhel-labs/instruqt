To get started, an already created playbook has been created that uses both the kernel-settings and session recording system roles. You can inspect the contents of this lab provided playbook to get some more information about what it will do on your system.

```bash
cat soe.yml
```

The output should look like this.
<pre>
---
- hosts: localhost
  vars:
    kernel_settings_sysctl:
      - name: vm.swappiness
        value: 20
      - name: vm.dirty_ratio
        value: 40
      - name: vm.dirty_expire_centisecs
        value: 500
      - name: vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs
        value: 100
      - name: kernel.sem
        value: "250 32000 100 128"
    tlog_scope_sssd: all
  roles:
    - role: rhel-system-roles.kernel_settings
    - role: rhel-system-roles.tlog
</pre>
From the above output, this playbook will only affect `localhost`. Also, at the bottom, you will notice the roles included, `kernel_settings` and `tlog` (session recording) in the playbook. Because these are the only roles included in the playbook, the `vars` section has variables that are used by these roles.

The `vars` under the kernel_settings_sysctl section are the values of parameters to set on the system to change kernel tunables in the /proc/sys directory structure. The tlog_scope_sssd setting will enable session recording for all users on the system.

Before you run the playbook and adjust the settings of the system, verify the current setting for one of the playbook affected values `vm.swappiness`.

```bash
cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```

The output should be
<pre>
30
</pre>

After you run the playbook, the swappiness value should be updated to be 20.

> <em>NOTE:</em> swappiness is a setting that determines the kernel's preference for using swap space on the system, the value is between 0-100. The smaller the value, the less preference the kernel has for utilizing swap space.

<!-- Execute the playbook that includes our updated settings deployed through RHEL System roles.
```
ansible-playbook soe.yml
```

Here's the output.
<pre>
PLAY [localhost] *************************************************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *******************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

<<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>>

PLAY RECAP *******************************************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=16   changed=9    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=7    rescued=0    ignored=0
</pre>
After a lot of output, you can see from the output at the bottom of the snippet above, how many elements on the system were changed.

You may have noticed that for session recording, the `tlog` system role managed installing the software needed for session recording in addition to executing the configuration parameters included in the playbook. -->

Let's apply these roles to `localhost` and `client1`. We need to create a `hosts.ini` file specifying the hostname `client1`. This host will be part of the `clients` group. For localhost, we'll specify that ansible should execute the playbook locally.

```text
cat > hosts.ini << EOF
localhost  ansible_connection=local
[clients]
client1
EOF
```

```bash
cat hosts.ini
```

The `hosts.ini` should contain the following.

<pre>
[clients]
client1
</pre>
Edit the `soe.yml` playbook to add the `clients` host group. This tells ansible to apply the system roles in `soe.yml` to `localhost` and `client1`.

```bash
sed -i '/^- hosts: localhost/ s/$/, clients/' soe.yml
```

Check the soe.yml file.

```bash
cat soe.yml
```

<pre>
---
- hosts: localhost, clients
  vars:
    kernel_settings_sysctl:
      - name: vm.swappiness
        value: 20
      - name: vm.dirty_ratio
        value: 40
      - name: vm.dirty_expire_centisecs
        value: 500
      - name: vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs
        value: 100
      - name: kernel.sem
        value: "250 32000 100 128"
    tlog_scope_sssd: all
  roles:
    - role: rhel-system-roles.kernel_settings
    - role: rhel-system-roles.tlog
</pre>
Now run the playbook again to apply the system roles to the clients group.

```bash
ansible-playbook soe.yml -i hosts.ini
```

Check the swappiness kernel parameter has changed on `client1`.

```bash
for i in client1; do echo -n "$i : " ; ssh $i cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness; done
```

<pre>
root@rhel:~# for i in client1; do ssh $i cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness; done
client1 : 20
</pre>
