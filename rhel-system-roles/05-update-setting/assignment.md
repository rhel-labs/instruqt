Now that you have a working ansible playbook to standardize the configuration of settings on your system, suppose that you realize one of the settings needs to be changed.

Update the swappiness value in the playbook to be set to 10. This will lower the kernel's preference for utilizing swap space. You might make this change because you are running a workload, like a database, that benefits from having more data kept in memory rather than being swapped out to the swap space.

```bash,run
sed -ie 's/value: 20/value: 10/' soe.yml
```

In the above command, you used sed to make an inline edit to the soe.yml file. You can verify that the change was correctly made by looking at the playbook contents.

```bash,run
cat soe.yml
```

<pre>
---
- hosts: localhost, clients
  vars:
    kernel_settings_sysctl:
      - name: vm.swappiness
        value: 10
      - name: vm.dirty_ratio
        value: 40
      - name: vm.dirty_expire_centisecs
        value: 500
      - name: vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs
        value: 100
      - name: kernel.sem
        value: "250 32000 100 128"
    tlog_scope_sssd: all
    timesync_ntp_servers:
      - hostname: time-d-b.nist.gov
        iburst: yes
      - hostname: 0.rhel.pool.ntp.org
        iburst: yes
  roles:
    - role: rhel-system-roles.kernel_settings
    - role: rhel-system-roles.tlog
    - role: rhel-system-roles.timesync
</pre>

Now that the settings have been updated, run the playbook again so that the changes applied to the three systems.

```bash,run
ansible-playbook soe.yml -i hosts.ini
```

<pre>
PLAY [localhost, clients] **********************************************************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *************************************************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]
ok: [client1]

<<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>>

PLAY RECAP ***************************************************************************************************
client1                    : ok=38   changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=31   rescued=0    ignored=0
localhost                  : ok=38   changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=31   rescued=0    ignored=0
</pre>

After the playbook has completed, you can verify that the change has been applied to the system.

```bash,run
ssh client1 cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```

<pre>
10
</pre>
This lab has focused on building a playbook using RHEL system roles to generate a standard set of configuration for the system, then using that playbook to make further changes to the system. Now that you have a working playbook it would be trivial to change the hosts that it applies to `localhost` to a set of systems on the network, like `client1`. As a result, if updates needed to be made to parameters, like you did to the swappiness setting, for the entire fleet of systems, you could update the playbook, then execute it across the systems to propagate the change.
