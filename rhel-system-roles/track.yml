description: |-
  # Duration:
  This track has an estimated time for completion of 10 minutes. The track will remain online for 50 minutes.
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to configure systems using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) System Roles.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  - Installing software needed for RHEL System Roles
  - Configuring a system using RHEL System Roles
  - Adding new configuration using RHEL System Roles to apply to systems
  - Applying updated configuration settings to systems

  # Example Usecase:
  You have a set of database servers, these servers need kernel settings and time settings applied to them. Additionally, you want to record terminal sessions for auditing. When a change needs to be made to the configuration, you want to apply the changes to all your database servers to keep them all updated with the same configuration options.
