    # Goal:

    In this lab you will manage a virtual machine running in image mode. You'll explore how bootc tracks images, changes host purposes, and rolls back changes.

    In the first exercise, you will explore how `bootc` tracks images and get an imported VM using a new registry.

    As you move through the exercises, there will be blocks marked `bash` with commands to be run in the right side bar. These may also have a `copy` feature to place the command into your buffer for pasting, and a `run` feature which will automatically execute the command. You can use any of these methods to complete the exercises.

Welcome to this lab experience for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The system displayed beside this text is a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 system registered with Subscription Manager.

In a [previous image mode lab](https://www.redhat.com/en/introduction-to-image-mode-for-red-hat-enterprise-linux-interactive-lab), we created a virtual machine from a bootc image. Adapting to changes in infrastructure or role is core to how bootc hosts operate. We'll explore how `bootc` tracks images, changes host purposes, and rolls back changes.

Changing registries for our bootc image
===

In the normal course of operations, available infrastructure is often changed or decommissioned in favor of newer options. In our environment, the registry server we've been using has been swapped out for a new server.

Unfortunately, this host was missed during that migration and we need to get it back on track. There's native tooling in `bootc` that lets us change the image that a particular host is using.

Connect to the console of the VM running our bootc image
===

Let's connect to the virtual machine via SSH. Switch to the [button label="VM SSH session" background="#ee0000" color="#c7c7c7"](tab-1) tab.

> [!NOTE]
> If the SSH session hasn't connected or there is an error, you can reconnect by clicking Refresh next to the tab name. The prompt will look like this. ![](../assets/terminal_prompt.png)

You can use the following credentials to log in.

Password:

```bash,run
redhat
```

Check the image the VM is using
===
Hosts created from bootc images track a particular image in a specific registry. This is how `bootc` knows when an update is available.  When `bootc` tries to look for an update, you get a `no such host` error.

```bash,run
sudo bootc upgrade --check
```

The spec section of bootc status provides the information about the image in use and where `bootc` is looking for it.

```bash,run
sudo bootc status | grep spec: -A 4
```
In the output you can see the hostname (and port if needed) as well as the image name. You will also notice the `transport` line, which confirms that we are getting updates for this image from a registry.

Switch to a new image
===
The hostname for our new central registry is **[[ Instruqt-Var key="CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT" hostname="rhel" ]]**.
We can migrate this host to our new registry with `bootc switch`. Note that we haven't changed the repository name or tag, just the registry hostname.
```bash,run
sudo bootc switch [[ Instruqt-Var key="CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT" hostname="rhel" ]]/test-bootc
```

At first glance, `bootc switch` doesn't look very different from `bootc upgrade`. It will download and prepare the new image to a local deployment location on disk. It downloads any layers it detects are different based on the metadata available in the registry.

We can see in the output of `bootc switch` that our new image has been queued to be activated the next time the host boots. We can also see if there are any changes waiting by checking `bootc status`.

```bash,run
sudo bootc status
```

If we needed to wait for a maintenance window we could stage the changes, then schedule the reboot. Let's restart the system now to get our changes.

```bash,run
sudo reboot
```

Once the system has completed rebooting, you can log back in by clicking the refresh button.

Password:

```bash,run
redhat
```

Since update tracking is one of the key features that needs current and correct locations, let's confirm that `bootc` is using our new registry to check for any updates.

```bash,run
sudo bootc upgrade --check
```
We've confirmed we're using the new registry, and we've got the latest version of our image running.

You can also check what the current `spec` section of `bootc status` now says about where updates are coming from.
```bash,run
sudo bootc status | grep spec: -A 4
```
You can also see `No staged image present` in `bootc status` since there are no prepared changes.

```bash,run
sudo bootc status
```

Once a host it running, changing the image in use is very straightforward, and can be useful for a number of reasons beyond changing image locations. Let's explore a little more of what `bootc switch` can do for us in the next few exercises.
