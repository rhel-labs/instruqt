teaser: Learn the basics of creating SELinux Policy.
description: |-
  This workshop will walk you through the process of creating a custom policy for a source-compiled application, using the standard tooling provided in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This is not a daunting effort. Jump in!

  This is not a 15 minute lab. It is a workshop level lab that needs 4-6 hours to complete. This is designed to go with an instructor guided session but can be completed on its own.

  # Goal:
  After completing this workshop you will be able to manage SELinux configuration on a RHEL host manually and with RHEL System Roles, write a basic SELinux policy and apply that policy to the system and troubleshoot SELinux issues using logs.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Managing SELinux system configuration
  * Understand SELinux context
  * Create a custom SELinux policy
  * Define rules for applications
  * Define rules for the network

  # Example Use case:
  An administrator wants to secure a custom application using SELinux policy
