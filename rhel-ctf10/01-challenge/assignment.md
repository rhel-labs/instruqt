    # Find my lost file

    Help Request from Joe Smith:

    I made a file, and I was trying to move it, and must have mis-typed something because it's not where I thought I put it.  Can you help me find it? These leenux systems are so confusing, I'm going back to Windows.

    I think I called the file `super notes.txt`
