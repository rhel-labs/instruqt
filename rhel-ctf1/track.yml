description: |-
  You've walked in to the office, and barely feel the warmth of your first mug of coffee when your boss, **Scott**, calmly walks up to you.

  "Yeah, so look, theres a problem.  You were out yesterday, and... you know, I _couldn't_ bother you because of that pesky company policy thing...  Anyway, you know before being a manager, I did the same work as you, so I handled a few things for you.  You're welcome!"
