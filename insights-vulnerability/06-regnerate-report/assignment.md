Now, if you go back to Vulnerability -> Reports, and generate a new detailed report, you should see one less system listed next to the CVE we fixed.  

Of course this only addressed one CVE on one system.  To perform this task at a larger scale you could select all hosts impacted by the CVE, and then use the Remediate button to either generate a playbook to fix these systems using Ansible, or remotely execute the fix if you have the proper subscriptions to do so.
