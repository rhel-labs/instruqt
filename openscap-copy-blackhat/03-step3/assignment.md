# Scan and generate a report

A XCCDF document is a structured collection of security configuration rules for some set of target system. In this case, it has the
configuration rules that meet the PCI regulation.

To start scanning using OpenSCAP, use the *oscap xccdf eval* command with the profile Id, option to fetch remote resources, output XML results file, and
the datastream file.

```bash,run
oscap xccdf eval --fetch-remote-resources --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss --results /tmp/scan-xccdf-results.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel9-ds.xml
```

> [!NOTE]
> This scan can take a few minutes to complete as it has to evaluate all the rules, and generate a XML file that has the results.

Once the scan completes, you can look at the pass/fail status of each rule in the output -

The XML results file can be transformed into HTML or plain-text format for easier readability -

```bash,run
oscap xccdf generate report /tmp/scan-xccdf-results.xml > /var/www/html/index.html
```

Now that the HTML report is generated, you can check the *OpenSCAP Report* tab of this lab interface to view the results (You may need to refresh the OpenSCAP Report tab using the refresh button at the upper-right of the instruqt tab).

![OpenSCAP-Report](../assets/Openscan-Report-Fail.png)

In the report, you will notice that several rules have failed. If you scroll to the bottom of the HTML report, you will find a failed rule related to *IPSec Support*. If you click the failed rule, you can get more details including the Rule ID, severity and description.

Take a note of the Rule ID for this failed rule as it will be used in the next step.
