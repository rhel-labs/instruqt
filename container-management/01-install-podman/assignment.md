In this lab, you will install Grafana, a browser-based data dashboard, in two ways. First, you will install and run it through the RHEL web console. After that, you will install and configure the Grafana container through Podman's command line interface (CLI).

First, install RHEL Container Tools by running the following command:
```bash
dnf install -y container-tools
```
Container Tools includes Podman along with other applications that make it easier to manage containers on RHEL, and it is available for all RHEL subscriptions, including the free [Developer Subscription for Individuals](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/faqs-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux#). To learn more about Podman, check out this helpful [Podman Cheat Sheet](https://developers.redhat.com/cheat-sheets/podman-cheat-sheet).

Start Podman using `systemctl`
```bash
systemctl start podman
```

Using `systemctl`, allow Podman to start every time the system boots:
```bash
systemctl enable podman
```
