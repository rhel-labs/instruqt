# Navigating the Insights service

Now that you have logged in, you will see an overview of all systems registered to your organization in the dashboard.

For the purposes of this exercise, you are working with a single machine registered to the Insights service.  Click on the _Inventory_ link on the left navigation bar.

Once you are on the Inventory page, find and click your hostname to pull up information for your individual machine.  Recall in a previous step you found your machine hostname with the `hostname` command.
