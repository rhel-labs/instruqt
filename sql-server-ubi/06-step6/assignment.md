# Checkpoint and restore the SQL Server container

Podman can be used to checkpoint and restore running containers. Podman uses CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace) to save the contents of the memory of a container (in a checkpoint file) and launch a container from the saved checkpoint file (restore). This greatly improves container portability, and reduces  application start up or cache warming time.

To install the CRIU dependency package (__criu__) that is needed for checkpoint-restore podman functionality execute -

```
yum -y install criu
```

Package criu-3.14-2.module+el8.3.0+8221+97165c3f.x86_64 is already installed.
Complete!
</pre>

After installing the criu package, create a configuration file to adjust the maximum ghost file limit. By default, 1MB is the maximum size of a deleted file that criu can handle, but in the case of SQL Server, temporary files might exceed this limit and hence the ghost-file size must be adjusted.

```
echo ghost-limit = 40000000 > /etc/criu.conf
```

In the *Terminal Server* tab of the lab interface, checkpoint the running SQL Server container and export the checkpoint to a compressed file

```
podman container checkpoint -l --export=/tmp/checkpoint1.tar.gz
```

</pre>

Taking a checkpoint without the *--leave-running* option will stop the running container. At this point, confirm that there is no running container -

```
podman ps
```

<pre class="file">
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE  COMMAND  CREATED  STATUS  PORTS  NAMES
</pre>

Now, restore the container from the stored checkpoint file. This capability can be quite useful in the case of a migration or debugging scenario.

```
podman container restore --import=/tmp/checkpoint1.tar.gz --name mssqlserver-restored
```

</pre>

Finally, verify that the container restored from the checkpoint file is running - The name of the container should be *mssqlserver-restored*

```
podman ps
```

<pre class="file">
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                                            COMMAND               CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS                   NAMES
ea72c83f945a  mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/rhel/server:2019-latest  /opt/mssql/bin/sq...  About a minute ago  Up About a minute ago  0.0.0.0:1400->1433/tcp  mssqlserver-restored
</pre>

Also, notice that the port mapping matches the original port mapping (Host port *1400* maps to container port *1433*).
