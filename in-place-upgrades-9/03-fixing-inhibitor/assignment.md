You saw in the last step how Leapp produced an error in order to prevent a broken upgrade.  In order to fix this issue, you will need to disable this feature in the sshd configuration file:

```bash,run
sed -i 's/PermitRootLogin yes/PermitRootLogin no/g' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

There are other risks that were identified. If you are curious what else Leapp found, take a closer look at the log file mentioned in the previous step:

```bash,run
cat /var/log/leapp/leapp-report.txt
```

Re-run the preupgrade check to verify the change satisfied the result

```bash,run
leapp preupgrade --target 9.4
```

<pre class=file>
# leapp preupgrade --target 9.4
