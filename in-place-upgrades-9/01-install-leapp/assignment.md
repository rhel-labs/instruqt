    # Overview

    After completing this scenario, users will be able to upgrade from one major version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to 9.latest

    ## Concepts included in this scenario:

      * Run pre-upgrade analysis and troubleshoot
      * Perform an in-place upgrade with Leapp

    For additional information refer to the leapp tool's documentation:
    https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/upgrading_from_rhel_8_to_rhel_9/index

    ## Example Usecase:

    A Systems Administrator needs to upgrade deployed Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers from their current version to the next major version to take advantage of a longer lifecycle and new features without needing to perform a clean install.

What is Leapp?
===

Red Hat's leapp tool provides existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux instances to an upgrade path from one major version to the next. This can be done on a one-to-one basis or en mass with a tool like Satellite. The Leapp tooling also includes a pre-upgrade assistant that makes it easy to identify breaking changes or warn about potential issues before any lasting changes are made to the system.

Before diving in, the question you have to ask is: is this workload worth executing a rebuild from scratch? That process can be tedious and time consuming. Doing an in-place upgrade retains the subscription, installed packages, user data, and configurations all while saving the time and resources required to deploy fresh.

Installing Leapp
===

To get started, it is highly recommended that you update all packages on your system to the latest version available.

```bash,run
dnf update -y && reboot
```

The terminal will lose connection with the rhel08 host leaving the message `Connection to rhel08 closed`.

Refresh the `rhel08` tab until you are reconnected.

Leapp is a supported operation for RHEL which means support tickets can be opened in case obstacles are encountered. It also means that the leapp utility is available straight from the Red Hat package repository. First, verify the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that you have installed:

```bash,run
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

<pre class=file>
# cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.10 (Ootpa)
</pre>

Since you are already running a properly registered RHEL machine, you do not need to enable any additional repositories. Instead, simply use the DNF package manager to install leapp and its dependencies:

```bash,run
dnf install -y leapp-upgrade
```

<pre class=file>
# dnf install -y leapp-upgrade
