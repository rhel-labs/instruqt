title: In Place Upgrade to RHEL 9
teaser: Performing an in-place upgrade with LEAPP
description: |-
  # Overview

  After completing this scenario, users will be able to upgrade from one major version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to 9.latest

  ## Concepts included in this scenario:

  * Run pre-upgrade analysis and troubleshoot
  * Perform an in-place upgrade with LEAPP

  For additional information refer to the leapp tool's documentation:
  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/upgrading_from_rhel_8_to_rhel_9/index

  ## Example Usecase:

  A Systems Administrator needs to upgrade deployed Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers from their current version to the next major version to take advantage of a longer lifecycle and new features without needing to perform a clean install.
