  # Overview:

  NetworkManager is a great tool for creating and modifying networks. This lab
  will walk you through creating your own network connection from scratch and
  modifying key parameters to control how that network connection behaves.

  # Goal:

  After completing this scenario, users will be able to configure the IP, hostname,
  and DNS for a connection using `nmcli`.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Learn NetworkManager (`nmcli`) syntax
  * Configure a new dynamic IP connection using DHCP
  * Update this connection to use static IP address assignment
  * Validate and configure DNS server settings
