title: File Access Policy BlackHat 8HR
teaser: Deploy and manage application control on Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems.
description: |-
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to deploy and manage application control on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Install the File Access Policy Daemon (fapolicyd)
  * Verify fapolicyd configuration and block unauthorized applications
  * Create a file-based trust database to allow trusted applications
  * Configure integrity checking for fapolicyd

  # Example Usecase:
  In this lab, you are going to configure application control for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 systems. Application control is a security approach designed to protect against unauthorized process execution on systems. When implemented correctly, application control helps mitigate the risk of malicious code (malware), such as ransomware, executing on a system.

  Application control is recognised by the Australian Signals Directorate as one of the most effective mitigation strategies in ensuring the security of systems. It is a recommended strategy included in the Australian Signals Directorate's [Essential Eight](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/publications/implementing-application-control) mitigation strategies, as well as the National Security Agency's (NSA) [Top Ten CyberSecurity Mitigation strategies](https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/what-we-do/cybersecurity/professional-resources/csi-nsas-top10-cybersecurity-mitigation-strategies.pdf).
