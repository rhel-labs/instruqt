    # Get the Check-list

    Manager Scott left you a DM on slack last night, he says:

    **Manager Scott** *(11:25PM)* :"Hey, I scheduled us months ago for our yearly compliance audit.  They're going to be there tomorrow.  I told them we follow the CIS Server Level 1 benchmark, that's cool right?  We definitely don't want to fail -another- audit."

    Can you get this system within 90% compliance with the **CIS Server Level 1** benchmark?
