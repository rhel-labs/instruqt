    # Can you import all of these users?

    Manager Scott says:
    "We've just hired 400 new employees!  Isn't that great!"

    Now you get to add all of the users.  Their names and usernames, are all in a CSV file in `/tmp/newusers.csv`

    Give all of them a temporary password of `superb1z` and set their accounts such that they must reset their passwords at their next login.
