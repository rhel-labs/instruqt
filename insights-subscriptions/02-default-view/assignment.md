In this step, we'll review the _default_ view in Insights Subscriptions.  This view defaults to the *RHEL for x86* view.

![Subscriptions default view](../assets/swatch-default-view.png)

In this view you are presented with three major items:

* The **Current instances** tab, which shows the systems which were used to generate the most recent tally
* The **Current Subscriptions** tab which shows the subscriptions which were used in the generation of the dotted line.
* The **usage chart**, which shows the summarized high-watermark usage (in sockets for RHEL and RHEL addons) broken out by deployment type (Physical, Virtual, Public Cloud, Hypervisor). Additionally this view shows your subscription capacity (the sum total of all subscriptions in this view) as a dotted line. By default this view shows the past 30 days, but can be changed


In the next step, we will have a look at the **Current Instances** tab.
