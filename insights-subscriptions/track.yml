description: |-
  # Overview

  As an administrator, you commonly need to inquire into where you are using Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and if you need to purchase more of it. The Subscriptions Service (aka Swatch) provides a means to look into this usage and make business decisions based upon it.

  ## Concepts included in this scenario:

  * Get an overview of your RHEL Subscription usage
  * Get a filtered view of your RHEL Subscirption usage

  ## Example Usecase:

  * You administer a fleet of RHEL systems, and need to keep your subscriptions within compliance.
