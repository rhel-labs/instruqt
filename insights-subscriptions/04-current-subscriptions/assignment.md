Below the usage graph, you'll also find the **Current Subscriptions** tab.  Click on that and we'll have a look at its contents.

Your list should look something like this:

![Current subscriptions list](../assets/swatch-current-subs-list.png)

On this tab, each entry includes the:
* **Product** - The name of the subscription
* **Service Level** - What is the expectation of support from Red Hat?
* **Quantity** - How many of these subscriptions have been purchased.
* **Sockets** - The total amount of sockets provided.
* **Next Renewal** - The next date a renewal for this subscription is occuring

Next, we'll have a look at that **usage graph** at the top.
