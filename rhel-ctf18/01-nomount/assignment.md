    # Filesystem Woes

    Oh great, you are here!  We are having a problem with one of our filesystems.

    If we reboot the system, it will not survive!

    Can you fix it?

Oh great, you are here!  We are having problem with one of our filesystems.
I'm trying to access my files in /data but it's not working, it is usually there when we start the system.

Can you fix it?
