This is a demonstration sandbox of the Command Line Assistant component of the RHEL Lightspeed project. Do not share this lab with anyone since it contains watsonx api keys.

Try asking CLA something.

```bash,run
c "how do I configure the timezone to Vancouver Canada"
```

Now ask it how to do more things!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The first time you run a query, it will fail because the CLA needs to create configuration files.
> The second query should work.
