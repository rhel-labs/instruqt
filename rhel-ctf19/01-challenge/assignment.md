    # Asset identification
    You are a sysadmin with sudo access, and have been tasked with finding the other machines on this network. 
    
    Once you have found it, you should be able to log into it with another user account with a service account, but the past sysadmin didn't leave notes on the service account. 
    
    You will need to identify the service account on your rhel machine then use it to connect to the other machine.

    What is the hostname of the other machine?
