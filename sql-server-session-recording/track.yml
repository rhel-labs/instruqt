title: Terminal Session Recording and SQL Server Auditing
description: |
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to enable review recorded sessions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and track activity inside SQL Server using SQL Server's auditing feature.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Installing software for Terminal Session Recording
  * Enabling and recording terminal sessions
  * List recorded sessions
  * Replay recorded sessions using Web Console
  * Enabling SQL Server auditing
  * Viewing the audit events in the SQL Server audit log file

  # Example Usecase:
  Your compliance officer needs to have session recording across all OS and database
  activity for high privileged users. The session recording can be used to review all
  the actions carried out at the OS level, while SQL Server's auditing feature can be
  used to record database actions.
