# Running the upgrade

Now that you have verified the RHEL system meets all the expected conditions, it is time to kick off the upgrade process: (Note: This process will take awhile.)

```
leapp upgrade --target 8.6
```

<pre class=file>
# leapp upgrade --target 8.6

        Scan the source system and identify files that will be copied into the target userspace when it is created.

The upgrade has only been _staged_; it has not been completed at this point. A reboot is required for the RHEL 8-based initial RAM disk image (initramfs), upgrades all packages and automatically reboots to the RHEL 8 system.

```
reboot
```

>**Pro Tip:** You can combine these two steps with the --reboot option
`leapp upgrade --target 8.6 --reboot`

The Leapp utility has staged all of the updates. Now, it is performing several actions inside a temporary environment. This includes creating a new initramfs image, relabeling SELinux contexts, and well as cleaning up any remaining RHEL 7 packages.

>**Disclaimer:**
The Leapp process can take upwards of 15 minutes to run. Instead of waiting for that process to complete, a second server has been running the upgrade in the background. Switch to the tab labeled RHEL2 to continue:

# Verifying the upgrade

Once the new initramfs image is in place, package updates run, and SELinux relabel completion, the system will perform one final reboot. Once that is done, you will be logged into the system's terminal once more. Finally, we will verify the update was successful by looking at the release file we referenced earlier in the lab:

```
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

Note that we are now running the latest version of RHEL 8!

<pre class=file>
# cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.6 (Ootpa)
</pre>

OPTIONAL: You may also review the log file if you so choose. The full output is available at /var/log/leapp/leapp-upgrade.log

```
less /var/log/leapp/leapp-upgrade.log
```

There are other methods for upgrading to the latest version of RHEL using the leapp tooling including the Web Console and Satellite. For those operations, refer to the documentation on Red Hat's website.
