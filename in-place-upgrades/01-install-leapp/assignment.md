    # Overview

    After completing this scenario, users will be able to upgrade from one major version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to the next. (Example RHEL 7 to RHEL 8)

    ## Concepts included in this scenario:

    * Run pre-upgrade analysis and troubleshoot
    * Perform an in-place upgrade with LEAPP

    For additional information refer to the leapp tool's documentation:
    https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/upgrading_from_rhel_7_to_rhel_8/index

    ## Example Usecase:

    A Systems Administrator needs to upgrade deployed Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers from their current version to the next major version to take advantage of a longer lifecycle and new features without needing to perform a clean install.

    Note: This process works similarly for RHEL 8 and 9.

# What is Leapp?

Red Hat's leapp tool provides existing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 instances to an upgrade path from one major version to the next. This can be done on a one-to-one basis or en mass with a tool like Satellite. The Leapp tooling also includes a pre-upgrade assistant that makes it easy to identify breaking changes or warn about potential issues before any lasting changes are made to the system.

Before diving in, the question you have to ask is: is this workload worth executing a rebuild from scratch? That process can be tedious and time consuming. Doing an in-place upgrade retains the subscription, installed packages, user data, and configurations all while saving the time and resources required to deploy fresh.

# Installing Leapp

To get started, it is highly recommended that you update all packages on your system to the latest version available. (Note: for this lab, updates have already been run for you.)

Leapp is a supported operation for RHEL which means support tickets can be opened in case obstacles are encountered. It also means that the leapp utility is available straight from the Red Hat package repository. First, verify the version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux that you have installed:

```
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

<pre class=file>
# cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 7.9 (Maipo)
</pre>

First, you need to enable the rhel-7-server repositories using the subscription-manager command:
>**Pro Tip:** See how you can actually combine these two operations into one!

```
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-rpms --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms

```

<pre class=file>
# subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-rpms --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
Repository 'rhel-7-server-rpms' is enabled for this system.
Repository 'rhel-7-server-extras-rpms' is enabled for this system.
</pre>

Next, use the DNF package manager to install leapp and its dependencies:

```
dnf install -y leapp-upgrade
```

<pre class=file>
# dnf install -y leapp-upgrade
