title: In Place Upgrade to RHEL 8
teaser: Performing an in-place upgrade with LEAPP
description: |-
  # Overview

  After completing this scenario, users will be able to upgrade from one major version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.9 to 8.latest

  ## Concepts included in this scenario:

  * Run pre-upgrade analysis and troubleshoot
  * Perform an in-place upgrade with LEAPP

  For additional information refer to the leapp tool's documentation:
  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/upgrading_from_rhel_7_to_rhel_8/index

  ## Example Usecase:

  A Systems Administrator needs to upgrade deployed Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers from their current version to the latest major version to take advantage of a longer lifecycle and new features without needing to perform a clean install.

  Note: We'll be publishing a lab soon covering the process for upgrading from RHEL 8 to RHEL 9.
