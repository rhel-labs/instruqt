title: In Place Upgrades
teaser: Performing an in-place upgrade with LEAPP
description: |-
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to upgrade from one major version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to the next. (Example RHEL 7 to RHEL 8)

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Run pre-upgrade analysis and troubleshoot
  * Perform an in-place upgrade with LEAPP

  # Example Usecase:
  A Systems Administrator needs to upgrade deployed Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers from their current version to the latest major version to take advantage of a longer lifecycle and new features without needing to perform a clean install.

  Note: This process works similarly for RHEL 8 and 9.
