    Looks like you found Nate's message, but you know how he likes to complicate things.

    Hopefully you can find the next clue he needs to escape the machine...

>Congratulations on completing the third step, your third flag code is: `sYRm9tcE`


In case you have forgotten, this is the last bit of the clue you recieved from Nate:

```nocopy
From what I can tell in here, looks like there is
a big process or something that is using a lot
of memory.  Can you find it and stop it?  After
that, I think I can slip back out of the machine
and into freedom!!!
```
