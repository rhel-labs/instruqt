Oh man, it's great to be out of that crazy machine!  Wait, the passkey is:
```nocopy
Scott
RULES
Nate
Drools
```

You know, my manager is named Scott, but this is far too complex for him to build, between you and me, he's mostly incompetent; always breaking things, making more work for us, etc.  There's no way he could have constructed this entire challenge, it must be someone else.  Maybe the new intern?  Is his name Scott as well?  Oh well, I guess some questions were never meant to be answered.  Thanks again for freeing me!  Now back to all those System Admin things I've got to do...

# Congratulations!
You freed Nate from the machine!
