    That Nate guy is never around when you need him.

    Looks like he's gotten caught in the machine, can you get him out?

    Good luck!

That Nate guy.  Somehow he's gotten trapped in the machine.

How?

I don't know, he went down to work on some guy named Flynn's computer and now here we are, he's trapped in the machine.

Anywho, can you save him?  Apparently he's left clues around the machine that you have to put together into some sort of message that he can then pass to  some sort of process on the machine to free him?  I don't know it all sounds very complex and I'm far too manager-y to really understand.  It's all just super annoying.  He keeps sending me emails from within the machine with the first thing he needs to be collected.  Let me read what he said:

**Scott: I've left the first clue in the /var/log/messages file.  You'll need to reconstitute it by isolating all the messages from the nate service!**
