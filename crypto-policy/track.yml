title: Configuring the system-wide cryptographic policy
description: |
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to use, modify, and
  troubleshoot changes to Red Hat Enterprise Linux's system-wide cryptographic
  policy.  The scenario uses the Apache web server as the example application.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Verify the current system-wide cryptographic policy setting
  * Change the current cryptographic policy setting
  * Troubleshoot applications after a cryptographic policy update
  * Modify application settings to comply with stronger cryptographic policies

  # Example Use case:
  Your security team requires using stronger cryptography algorithms with
  applications and is no longer allowing weaker algorithms, such as SHA-1.
