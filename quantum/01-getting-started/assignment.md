    # What is a quantum computer?
    Quantum computers leverage [quantum mechanics](https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsquantum-mechanics) to make calculations. In practice, they can be useful for highly complex computation such as physics simulations or breaking existing encryption algorithms.

    # How does quantum computing differ from classical computing?

    In classical computing, information is represented by bits (binary digits). Bits are binary, meaning they can have a logical state equal to one of two values (i.e., bits are either 0 or 1).

    In quantum computing, information is represented by qubits (quantum bits). Qubits can store the logical values of traditional bits (0 or 1), but they can also use [quantum superposition](https://scienceexchange.caltech.edu/topics/quantum-science-explained/quantum-superposition) to represent a proportion of 0 and 1. For example, a qubit could be 30% of 0 and 70% of 1.

    To learn more about the difference between bits and qubits, check out [this helpful article](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-qubit/).

    In essence, a qubit's ability to store more information means that a quantum computer can process much more information.

Before we start setting up the tools for quantum software development, it will be helpful to cover some of the basics of quantum computing.

# Quantum simulation stack on RHEL:
There are numerous ways to simulate quantum computing, each with unique pros and cons, but this is the configuration we will use in this lab:
1. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9
2. [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)
3. [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)
4. [Aer](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/aer/)
5. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

To install Conda, we must add its repository to the package manager. To enable this, we need to add EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux). EPEL is a repository derived from Fedora that provides additional development tools for RHEL.

```bash
subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-$(arch)-rpms
dnf install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
```

You are now ready to install Conda. To install, run the following commands:

```bash
dnf install -y conda #installs Conda
conda init bash #configures conda to our shell
exec $SHELL #restarts the shell to finish installation of Conda
```


Finally, run the following command to verify the installation of Conda. It will print out the version of Conda that is installed to confirm that the installation of Conda is complete:
```bash
conda -V
```
In the next step, you will configure the programming environment.
