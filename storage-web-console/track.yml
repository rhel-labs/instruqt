  This lab is intended to provide an introduction to using Stratis,

  Stratis is a local storage-management solution for Linux. It is focused on simplicity and ease of use, and gives you access to advanced storage features.

  Stratis makes the following activities easier:

  - Initial configuration of storage
  - Making changes later
  - Using advanced storage features

  Stratis is a local storage management system that supports advanced storage features. The central concept of Stratis is a storage pool. This pool is created from one or more local disks or partitions, and file systems are created from the pool.

  The pool enables many useful features, such as:

  - File system snapshots
  - Thin provisioning
  - Tiering
  - Encryption
