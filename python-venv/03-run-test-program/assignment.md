A test program has been created for you already. The program uses an API (via the request library) to retrieve and print a random fact about cats. If you wish to view or modify the source code, use the following command to open it using Vim:
```bash
vim /home/api.py
```
If you are new to Vim, check out this helpful guide to learn the basics:

To run the test program, make sure your environment is activated. Your command line should look like this:

If your environment is not activated, reactivate it with the following command:
```bash
source /home/python/sampleenvironment/bin/activate
```

Now, run the test program by running the following command:
```bash
python /home/api.py
```

You should see an output that contains a fact about a cat. This would not be possible without the virtual environment that was just created. To demonstrate why this would not work without the environment you set up, run the following command to deactivate your environment and then try running the program again. It will not be able to display a cat fact, and will instead print an error message.
```bash
deactivate
python /home/api.py
```
