Killing processes
===
Now that you found the `dd` process on Terminal 1, terminate it using the `kill` command. You would typically just manually enter the process ID after `kill`. The process ID is the second column of the `ps aux` output from before. However, to make this command clickable for each new lab instance the `pidof` (**P**rocess **ID of**) command is used to automatically find the process ID.

```bash,run
kill $(pidof dd)
```

Look for the `dd` process again.
```bash,run
ps aux | head -n1 ; ps aux | grep '[d]d '
```

There is no output because the process has been killed.

The `kill` command can send a variety of signals. Calling the command without any options will default to `-SIGTERM`. This command will inform the process that it is time for it to stop, but allow it to run any cleanup procedures that it has. This often takes the form of closing files and freeing memory. In this sense, `-SIGTERM` is the graceful option for terminating a process.

If you instead use the `kill -SIGKILL` command, this will instruct the kernel to immediately stop the process. This prevents any cleanup that may have otherwise occurred, leaving memory allocated and potentially leading to corrupted files. Therefore, only use `-SIGKILL` as a last resort.

> [!NOTE]
> You will also see the `kill` signals referred to numerically. `-SIGTERM`
is equivalent to `-15` and `-SIGKILL` is equivalent to `-9`.
