    # Overview:
    Package managers are centralized methods of accessing software repositories. Using package managers for installing and updating software removes many opportunities for user error and automates numerous installation steps. On RHEL, DNF is the default package manager, but you will also see RPM.

    # Goal:
    After completing this lab, users will feel comfortable adding, removing, and updating packages.

    # Concepts included in this scenario:
    * Install a package with `dnf`
    * Update and remove packages with `dnf`
    * Roll back a transaction with `dnf history`
    * Use `rpm` for detailed queries

Package managers are programs which install, update, and remove software. Doing these operations by hand would be tedious and prone to mistakes. Bundling these functionalities into a single tool gives users a more streamlined experience.

DNF has even more utility because it performs dependency resolution whenever it installs, removes, or updates software. The upcoming steps will give examples of how to use DNF to streamline your package management.

## Installing a package with `dnf`

Install the network analysis application Wireshark using `dnf`. This application is useful for troubleshooting network packets that are traveling in and out of your system. This functionality in particular is not important to this lab, this application was picked simply because it serves as a good test subject for the upcoming examples.

```bash
dnf -y install wireshark
```

>_Note:_ The `-y` option will automatically answer yes to any prompts during the installation. Using this option is not best practice when installing software on your own system, but it is useful for streamlining some operations in this lab.

This installation generates a large output, so here is a high level summary of what each section means. The first section shows all of the packages that must be installed as dependencies for Wireshark:

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Arch   Version         Repository                        Size
===================================================================
Installing:
wireshark
x86_64 1:2.6.2-12.el8  rhel-9-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms 3.7 M
Installing dependencies:
flac-libs
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
</pre>

The next section of the output shows a verification status for each dependent package. In this case, DNF made sure that 36 other packages were up to date.

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Verifying        : libgudev-232-4.el8.x86_64               35/36
Verifying        : pcre2-utf16-10.32-2.el8.x86_64          36/36
Installed products updated.
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
</pre>

The final section of the output is a list of all of the packages that were installed in support of Wireshark's installation.

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Installed:
  flac-libs-1.3.2-9.el8.x86_64
  glx-utils-8.4.0-5.20181118git1830dcb.el8.x86_64
  gsm-1.0.17-5.el8.x86_64
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

Complete!
</pre>

You can verify this installation with the `dnf list` command:

```bash
dnf list wireshark
```

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Installed Packages
wireshark.x86_64
         1:2.6.2-12.el8 @rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
</pre>

This shows how powerful DNF is, as a single command will take care of the installation
seamlessly. Next you will see how to update and remove packages with `dnf`.
