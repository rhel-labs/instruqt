Using package managers for installing and updating software removes many opportunities for user error and automates numerous installation steps. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, DNF is the default package manager, but you will also see RPM.
  # Goal:
  After completing this lab, users will feel comfortable adding, removing, and updating packages.
  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Install a package with `dnf`
