The `list` subcommand is useful for finding out which packages have available
updates on the system.

```bash
dnf list updates
```

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Available Upgrades
bash.x86_64              4.4.20-2.el8                               rhui-rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rhui-rpms
chrony.x86_64            4.1-1.el8                                  rhui-rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rhui-rpms
systemd.x86_64           239-51.el8_5.3                             rhui-rhel-8-for-x86_64-baseos-rhui-rpms

</pre>

Many packages on this system have updates available. Specifying a package name with `dnf update` will constrain this operation to only look for that package.

>_NOTE:_ If you instead want to make sure your entire system is up to date, running `dnf update` without any other arguments apply updates for all packages on your system (including YUM itself).

At the time of writing this lab, the __bash__ package required an update. Let's update __bash__. Use the `-y` option to automatically say yes to any prompts for the purposes of this lab.

Feel free to update any package listed.

```bash
dnf -y update bash
```

>_NOTE:_ You sometimes see the subcommand `upgrade` being used somewhat interchangeably with `update`. The difference between these two subcommands is that `upgrade` will remove any obsolete packages from the system. Often the configuration for DNF is such that these subcommands will both carry out the `upgrade` operation.

## Removing a package

Removing a package follows the same theme of simplicity.

```bash
dnf -y remove httpd
```

The extensive output shows you information about which dependent RPMs were
removed as part of this transaction.

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Removing:
 httpd            x86_64 2.4.37-39.module+el8.4.0+9658+b87b2deb

Removing dependent packages:
 mod_ssl          x86_64 1:2.4.37-39.module+el8.4.0+9658+b87b2deb

Removing unused dependencies:
 apr              x86_64 1.6.3-11.el8

<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>

Removed:
  httpd-2.4.37-39.module+el8.4.0+9658+b87b2deb.x86_64
  httpd-filesystem-2.4.37-39.module+el8.4.0+9658+b87b2deb.noarch
  httpd-tools-2.4.37-39.module+el8.4.0+9658+b87b2deb.x86_64

Complete!
</pre>

Use the `list` subcommand to confirm that the package has been uninstalled:

```bash
dnf list httpd
```

<pre class=file>
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Available Packages
httpd.x86_64 2.4.37-39.module+el8.4.0+9658+b87b2deb
</pre>

The package is now listed as _Available_ rather than _Installed_. The next step will walk you through `dnf history` which provides some more powerful tools for rolling back package transactions.
