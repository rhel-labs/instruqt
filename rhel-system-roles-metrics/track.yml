title: Visualize performance on your Red Hat Enterprise Linux Infrastructure with
  RHEL System Roles Metrics role
teaser: Learn how RHEL System Roles can automatically configure an observability infrastructure
  for you.
description: |
  # Overview:
  In this lab, we'll set up a Grafana server to visualize performance metrics collected with Performance Co-Pilot, running on Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts.

  Grafana is an open source project that enables the querying and visualization of performance data.
  Performance Co-Pilot is a system performance analysis toolkit that collects metrics.

  # Goal:

  Configure and install an observability infrastructure with RHEL System Roles Metrics role.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:

  * Create an Ansible playbook to run the Metrics System Role.
  * Use the Metrics System Role will configure and install Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) on RHEL9 hosts.
  * Use the Metrics System Role will configure and install Grafana on a specified host to visualize the PCP data.
