Introduction
===
Now we'll register the hosts `rhel1` and `rhel2` to our Satellite server. We'll use the command line interface to generate a registration command in this lab.

It is also possible to generate a registration command from the Satellite WebUI but due to the limitations of DNS in this lab environment, we'll use the cli utility `hammer` to simplify the process.

In our registration command, we'll specify that the new host should be added to the `Application Servers` host group we just created. As well, we'll ignore certificate errors (since we're using a self signed certificate) and we won't set up Insights.

Create a registration script
===
Click on the [button label="Satellite Server"](tab-0) tab.

Click on the `run` button to run the following command in the `Satellite Server` terminal.

```bash,run
hammer host-registration generate-command --hostgroup "Application Servers" --insecure 1 --setup-insights 0 --force 1
```

The output of this command is a curl command similar to this (don't copy paste this):

```nocopy
set -o pipefail && curl -sS --insecure 'https://satellite.lab/register?force=true&hostgroup_id=1&setup_insights=false' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0LCJpYXQiOjE2ODI2MjkyNzcsImp0aSI6ImQ1YjFkYThmYzM4OGY5ZjY0MmEyZjc0ZGFhNjRkMmZjODVmZDhiNjU1Y2E3NmM3ODEyYWQ5ZjQzNWE0NWE5Y2UiLCJleHAiOjE2ODI2NDM2NzcsInNjb3BlIjoicmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uI2dsb2JhbCByZWdpc3RyYXRpb24jaG9zdCJ9.bgS1XqSYd4bsY46Suq7QqC5OSKm3bSsN57c3lddiOkU' | bash
```
Copy the output by highlighting the selected text. Once the primary click mouse, button is released, the text will be automatically saved to the clipboard.

Register hosts

Now click on the [button label="rhel1"](tab-2) tab.

Right click and select paste to paste the command into the terminal. Finally type enter to execute the registration command.

When your host is registered, the output will resemble something similar below.

Register `rhel2` with the Satellite server by pasting the registration command into the CLI of `rhel2`.

In the Satellite Web UI, navigate to `All Hosts` to view the newly registered host.

You can check that your host repos are configured for the Satellite server `satellite.lab` by running the following:

```bash,run
cat /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo
```
