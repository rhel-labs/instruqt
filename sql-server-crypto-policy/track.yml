title: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Crypto Policy With SQL Server
description: |
  # Goal:
  After completing this scenario, users will be able to use, and modify
  Red Hat Enterprise Linux's system-wide cryptographic policy applied to
  Microsoft SQL Server.

  # Concepts included in this scenario:
  * Verify the current system-wide cryptographic policy setting
  * Change the current cryptographic policy setting
  * Connect to SQL Server using a strongly encrypted TLS connection

  # Example Use case:
  Your security team requires using stronger cryptography algorithms with
  applications and is no longer allowing weaker algorithms with lower bit
  lengths. They also require encryption of sensitive data at rest.
