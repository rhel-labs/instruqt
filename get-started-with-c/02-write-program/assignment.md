A directory for your source code has been created for you. Move to the C_source directory by running the following command

```bash,run
cd /home/C_source
```

Run the following command to create a "Hello World" program in C:

```bash,run
cat > helloworld.c << EOF
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello World!\n");
   return 0;
}
EOF
```

If you are more comfortable creating a C++ program, use this instead:

```bash,run
cat > helloworld.cpp << EOF
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
   return 0;
}
EOF
```

You can use shell tools like `vim` to edit your code in RHEL, but you can also use popular text editors and IDEs including Eclipse, VSCode, Sublime Text, and CLion. These make it easier to test and collaborate on your code.
