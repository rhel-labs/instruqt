title: RPM Packaging Workshop
description: |-
  # Goal:

  In this lab you will take a "Hello World" program written in bash and create an RPM package for it.

  To accomplish this you will write RPM spec files.
  This involves defining metadata in the preamble,
  writing the build and install process in the body,
  working with changelog entries,
  and more.

  >**NOTE:** This lab environment will expire in a little less than 1 hour.
